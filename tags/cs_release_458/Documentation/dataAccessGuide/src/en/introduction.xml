    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>When developing robust .NET connected applications, it is often a
    good idea to isolate the specifics of your persistence implementation
    behind a common API. Data Access Objects allow you to create simple
    components that provide access to your data without revealing the
    specifics of the implementation to the rest of your application. Using
    DAOs, you can allow your application to be dynamically configured to use
    different persistence mechanisms. If you have a complex application with a
    number of different databases and persistence approaches involved, DAOs
    can help you create a consistent API for the rest of your application to
    use.</para>
