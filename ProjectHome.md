> The **MyBatis.NET** data mapper framework makes it easier to use a relational database with object-oriented applications. **MyBatis.NET** couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor or annotations. Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the **MyBatis.NET** data mapper over object relational mapping tools.

> To use the **MyBatis.NET** data mapper, you rely on your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don't already know. With the **MyBatis.NET** data mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored procedures at your fingertips.

> The **MyBatis.NET** project is developed and maintained by a team that includes the maintainers of the "iBATIS.net" data mapper.
